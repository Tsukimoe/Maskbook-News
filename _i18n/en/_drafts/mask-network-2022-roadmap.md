Mask Network is building the Web3 dApplet store right on Web2. It allows any content to be seamlessly integrated, displayed, or interactive on existing social media platforms such as Twitter. Users can send encrypted messages, trade cryptocurrencies, and even use Dapps (Defi, NFTs) over the most popular Web2 social networks like Twitter and Instagram.

Since the beginning, Mask has been trying to attract the billions of users in Web 2.0 into Web 3.0. We are tremendously fortunate to have the crypto community increasingly taking note of us, especially after the introduction of the Mask Portal browser extension. With Vitalik and many other crypto leaders encouraging and supporting our efforts, we feel we are on the right path to achieve our goal of attracting billions of users into Web 3.0 through Mask.

There are three basic principles we feel are extremely important in getting more people into Web 3.0:

1. User experience: We want to create a level of user experience that parallels or even exceeds the best that Web2 has to offer.
2. Invest in the future: To get so many people coming onto Web 3.0 requires a continuous stream of Web3 killer apps coming into being. We want to create an open and supportive environment for the discovery, empowerment, and generation of traffic to the people that will create these killer-apps.
3. Guaranteeing user privacy, equality in opportunity, fairness in access, and freedom of interpretation.

We see Mask as the global bridge connecting Web2 and Web3. It is fundamentally a public good just like Ethereum. Therefore, the team has decided to guide the future development of the Mask layer to a decentralized model similar to that of Ethereum. The focus of the official team should be solely focused on the continuous development of the core functionalities of Mask to better fulfill its principal mission, funding teams who have great ideas that can translate into potential killer dapps, and continuously improving the experiences of builders, users and anyone else who wants to use Mask to connect billions of users with their projects.

Through the provision of funds, we have supported several innovative Web3 projects that have more than 700k users between them. We have also supported Transak, a KYC free on-ramp solution that enables the direct purchase of tokens via credit card for more than 30 different fiat currencies, and have already been integrated to Mask’s core stack so users can purchase tokens seamlessly and conveniently on Twitter.

We are also chained agnostic and have been integrating other chains such as BSC onto Mask in order to provide as wide coverage and as simple integration as possible for developers. While most popular dApps are based on Ethereum, other chains might serve as dedicated layer 2 for a specific area of innovation. It is one version of the future where ETH 2.0 will be a network of chains. To prepare for that possibility, we aim to make our functions such as payment/red packet chain agnostic, and eventually cross-chain.

Mass adoption happens when Mask has something that is appealing for the ordinary person who is not DeFi degen to stick around. We believe crypto mass adoption can be most readily achieved through NFTs, which have a strong affinity with IP monetization and multimedia content creation such as gaming, arts, and entertainment. These multi-sensory content forms have much broader mass appeal than DeFi or blockchain technology content. Therefore, supporting and attracting builders with a variety of ideas and backgrounds become crucial to the continued success of Mask.

Most importantly, we are building a better version of the internet. We are not tearing down the walls of Web2, but we are changing it for the better. We want to ensure user-friendliness, and also create a public good that respects the privacy of people, protects the security of people’s data and funds, and gives the freedom of interpretation back to the typical internet users.
