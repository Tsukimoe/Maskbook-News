We are happy to announce that we have integrated with OpenOcean, now that OpenOcean has become one of the swap options within Mask Network, which will give users better price rates on their trades.

OpenOcean is a trading protocol aggregator and has aggregated 14 chains at the moment. OpenOcean supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, Polygon, Solana, Boba, Terra, OEC, HECO, TRON, and Ontology, and supported Arbitrum and Gnosis (previously xDai) recently. OpenOcean’s most recent upgrade — OpenOcean Atlantic — provides users with algorithm and protocol upgrades to optimize trading for the maximum returns based on multiple parameters.

Mask Network has been cultivating the multi-chain arena as well. From supporting Ethereum only, to adding support to Binance Smart Chain, Polygon (Matic), and the recent support on Layer2 network Arbitrum and xDai (Gnosis Chain), Mask has been expanding its on-chain world, and will support Solana and Flow in the future.

Mask Network is thrilled to build the Web 3.0 infrastructure with OpenOcean. We have posted a joint bounty that hopes to integrate the OpenOcean Swap feature. The integration is finished, and we are constantly improving it. Mask Network is looking forward to more partnership opportunities with OpenOcean, and we welcome projects that share the vision of “building the new, open internet” to join us, so the Mask Network ecosystem could prosper.
