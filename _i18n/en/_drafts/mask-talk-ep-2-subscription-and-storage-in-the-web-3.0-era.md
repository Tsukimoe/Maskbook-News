**Joshua from RSS3 Gives a Brief Introduction:**

RSS3 aims to become the RSS of Web 3.0. In Web3 I see four layers working very closely together: Decentralized Storage, Publishing, Distribution, and Middleware. We will be seeing decentralized storage, Arweave provides, publishing we see with Mirror.xyz, distribution which RSS3 provides, and of course we have Mask as the ringer bringing all four layers together. Recently, things have been going great for RSS3. We shipped out the [RSS3.bio](https://rss3.bio/), which is the Web3 pass application and we got more users there. Recently, we also integrated Arweave, which means the written content published on decentralized platforms Mirror.xyz can be easily integrated.

**Sam Williams from Arweave gives a Brief Introduction:**

The idea of the base Arweave protocol is to create a new library of alexandria backed by endowments and a decentralized network. Such that essentially there's no single point of failure for the data so you can keep that information around for hundreds of years. I think hundreds of years is low balling it, we're going for thousands or tens of thousands of years. That's the core goal of the protocol on top of the base Arweave network which is all of that information made available to people's web browsers. That's useful because you can now see records of history very easily but also you can build entire applications on top of this thing, and those applications have really interesting and different control and power properties from normal Web 2 apps. Typically, in a website application you're accessing someone else's server, we're accessing Twitter right now. Twitter can just throw us off arbitrarily or they can change the offering so that it's run by ads and so on. And obviously with a permanent web application that can't happen to you. The developer can release a new version of the app which you can decide to use if you want to, but they can't force you to. We're really interested in changing the power dynamic in the Web 2 world. I would say that's more or less what the project is about.

**Suji**:

Great, so the topic today is Subscriptions and Storage in Web3. What do you think about decoration between the creative economy and especially those who are not enfp right now and and your partner and these maybe the future version of the web?

**Joshua**:

There was a very interesting trajectory in terms of how we got from the 1990s where we started to see know people having personal websites online or blogs online to the web 2 years where a lot of massive adoption was was made possible by those centralized services which then later on conducted a lot of evil stuff that led us to web 3. This whole trajectory was very interesting whereas we saw that in web one: functionality was the core. Gradually, (because web one was mostly made for developers or those who have technological backgrounds) we saw how this was much of a barrier for regular people to join the cyberspace and that was why centralized services starting in the Web 2.0 era was pretty easy for them to defeat web one personal blogs, decentralized blogs, websites, and of course RSS standards.

And then, I think after this massive adoption of having all different people in cyberspace , we came to an era where we started to realize how healthy, how democratic, and good a system Web3 as opposed to web 2 where we only cared about user experience. But now, we care more about user rights as well. This is sort of the development of any technology or even any social organization or structure whereas we start with something that's only workable to something that works better and provides better experience. Later on, we work on something more fundamental and structural that is if this system is working in a way that is healthy and that is better for human society as a whole. So, I think that's how we started working on this thing in 2021. Once again, something that's pretty similar or carries at least a pretty similar ideology the revolution that there was 20 years ago.

**Sam:**

I think on the back of that, at least as far as we see, I wouldn’t say that web 2 was really the middle period. There's actually three phases (arguably) of power on the web. So, in the first phase we had these open protocols, it's hard to call some of them decentralized but they were at least distributed. They were permissionless and that was amazing because it meant you now had IRC and everyone could build their favorite IRC client or modify that client. Or, there was RSS, of course, which brings us together today. You could do all sorts of cool stuff with RSS: You could remix it however you wanted and no one could stop you. But I think the fundamental problem that emerged: **All of this value is being created by the people building protocols, and they are capturing absolutely none of it.”**

And so, the power dynamics shifted on the web, not because people wanted to gain power. Ironically though that was definitely the eventual result. It was because they wanted to gain money. You see this with Google and so on. In the beginning they're all “don't be evil” but the second phase of power on the web was basically dominated by this thought process of: “well look, if we want to capture the value that we create, we have to have a company which controls the experience. And so, then you get these sort of moats essentially, which Iwould say really defined the second period.

And now the really exciting thing about our space is that actually you can build protocols that are monetized again and so they can have those same properties of openness and transparency and interoperability that we all love about the Web3 ecosystem.

But at the same time, now there's actually incentive to do it. If you think back to the first web “http”, open protocol right, built by Tim Berners-lee, Who built a one line protocol plain text in a few days, then he spent about 10 years trying to get it adopted and succeeded. He undoubtedly produced literally tens of trillions of dollars of value and captured absolutely none of that, which is really sad. And so, of course there's no incentive to do that. So, then we get these companies. That's where the action moved to, and then the power moved with it. Now, fortunately Ithink, we have the opportunity to move it back into the open space that the internet has always been. The ideal of the base of the thing anyway.

So that brings us to the second question around NFTs. Which is tangentially related Ithink. There’s this other component of Web 3 we're looking at: Is it possible to unlock some of the value that was also captured by those companies and give it to creators in a more open and fair fashion? And if we do that, can we actually make those platforms? I would argue the the unproven part at least so far is: Can we make it so that the web 3 projects and protocols grow faster than they did in the web 2 world

can you actually just increase the size of a pie and let creators take more of it.

**Suji:**

What do you think the end game will be from a storage or content system perspective as opposed to a token economy perspective?

**Sam:**

I think where we're going there will be rights related contracts associated with probably every transaction on the Arweave network. That’s because it' it's free to do so so when you start. When you post, you pay for two kilobytes worth of tags. Storage is really cheap, so there's not very much money in it. It's ten thousandths of a cent or something, but smartwatch contracts are initialized only from those tags. So, you can initialize a smartweave contract on literally every single piece of data you put on the perma web. So if you have an image you're using in the middle of an article or you've got the text of the article itself or a tweet on Argora or something, you can turn that into an NFT if you want. Literally for free, and and I think that that's only the beginning of where this goes, so I think there's a natural incentive to say: “Okay well, that's just free value sitting on the table. Why wouldn't we just make every single transaction into something where you have a rights related contract associated with it? So, I think that that's more or less inevitable, but I think that the NFT is not the final form. Ithink that what we'll ge is something we call profit sharing tokens in our ecosystem.

Actually, Al \[is in the Twitter Space\] here from KOI has been leading the way with his team on getting these, atomically associated profit sharing tokens adopted in the space. Their idea was: “Well what if we could make an attention getting market for the whole permaweb?” So, I have a piece of content I think lots of people are going to look at. I bet one token on it and then in the future more tokens are minted proportionately to the allocation of tension on the permaweb. Now you can monetize attention without having to sell access to people's brains via adverts. It's a huge step up. Al has got pretty far with that project already. I mean Koi is now a pretty big community. We see it moving in that direction. I don't think it's likely that if you have a web where everything can be an NFT- asset. Idon't think it'll just be nft ownership. I think it'll be sharing revenue streams associated with pieces of data. That's my guess at least.

**Suji:**

So it's if I collatterize my tweet into some protocol and then, because I generate revenue by advertising, then these revenues are going to be shared by the owner of my tweet. And they become my asset of this content-based security. Because we have asset backed securities based on the rent of your house for example. So you could have a tweet-based security or something that. So if I invest in a twitter account I'm not really just by buying the social token but the value makes it back to its creators and its creations. And maybe somehow I pass away maybe due to an accident or just I disappear into the metaverse and my art goes sky high in the next 200 years so as still owned by the family or whoever believed in this art in early days.

**Sam**

The profit sharing token idea is based on giving fundamental value to assets on the web. It's not it's not that's impossible that the web produces a huge amount of value and the content on it is the driver of the applications that are important too. But ultimately, without the content there would be nothing. So these profit sharing tokens that are atomically associated with the assets they're actually just hard tradable instruments and so I expect it will eventually get bots that are just arbitraging the opportunities there to buy and sell them, looking to maximize yield. I don't think it has to be a question of keeping it because it has an emotional value. I think we'll probably move to a world where there's hard value back in these things.

**Suji:**

What’s your thinking on this, Joshua?

**Joshua:**

I think one of the interesting things about RSS3 is that it carries some of the best characteristics from web 1 and web 2 and at the same time is decentralized. It is an open sorted protocol that can be permissionless when building a lot of different stuff on top of each other, and at the same time, it does carry this sort of social part. If you look at RSS compared to facebook or twitter, you wouldn't see a lot of the other actions after the subscription. It's a pretty simple procedure where you just subscribe and read stuff. Whereas in web 2 after you actually follow someone on twitter you have to do a lot of different interactions. You can ‘like’ something you can comment on something, you could retweet something and then these created this gigantic social graph for social networks that does tremendous things and makes that network so much stronger than than a simple one RSS did.

So for RSS3 we started considering how we should have these programmable links among files where you have relationships between users working natively with RSS3. This is programmable so it could be any type of relations we want to define by developers or even users. I think one more thing that really makes RSS3 interesting is by having this decentralized ownership and different stuff means a social token could be one of the ways to achieve that. Especially public social tokens and of course as we were talking about NFTs before, I think there could be very various types of ways that we cannot think of right now to to show how creators or or even developers could be profiting from something this because we don't define a business model or an economy circulation in RSS3 natively but as something that's permissionless. Something that's modulated. We are actually seeing the possibility where developers, creators and even users would be utilizing this protocol in order to build something that is more suitable for the battery economy.

**Suji:**

**We** talked about NFT storage Web3 subscriptions as a way to invest in your best friend. Recently, we have a lot of new integration on Mask Network such as the NFT Gallery what Twitter tried to promote and we actually delivered that. We have NFTs and storage and in my personal opinion I think it’s not going to be a completely new thing. It'll be something on top of the existing ones. But there's time for Mirror, right? To actually try to build a completely new thing instead of using Medium. I know Arweave is trying to build a new podcast network. Do you think it’s going to be a completely new way of interacting or or is it pretty much the same thing but with more economic incentive and ownership rights?

**Sam:**

We think that the new social networks will be built on top of the old social networks Mask network. An associated question would be: “Well, will the feature sets be the same or will they be different? I’ve always loved the way that Mask essentially cannibalizes the old social networks. So as soon as you told me about that Suji, I thought that was genius. If you want to bootstrap a web3 experience inside a social network, then jumping on top of the interface that's already there is perfect.

I think there will be social networks but I think there will be social network experiences that are pretty different. It strikes me that there's a war going on for the heart of Web 3 and no one really knows, no one really knows what the term actually means at this point. Adam, who I think is in the crowd, made this amazing thing called the Web3 Index looking at the protocol revenue recently. One of the questions we've been discussing in that group we have there was: How do we define this thing? It strikes me there's basically two superheated visions : power and money.

On the money side there's this question that we're exploring at the moment which is: “What can we do with NFTs and in the Arweave ecosystem, what can we do with profit sharing tokens to better split how that money which is generated by the platforms is distributed between content creators and the platforms themselves. On the power side, there's more basic stuff that we can do. The example I Would look at is Argora or Arweave news (???) is a great one too, and they have a podcasting application which answers to no one. Ialso think it’s integrated RSS3 recently, Ithink those experiences will be closer to web 2 they just won't be run by company at least to begin with and then at some point we're going to see a merging of these two ideas but not I’m not totally clear where that'll shake out yet. What do you think Joshua?

**Josh:**

I'll just talk about one example that's really interesting which is Mirror. I think they are one of the very interesting examples of trying to build a completely new service with the ideology and the infrastructures of web3. Compared to Medium, Mirror does a lot of very strange things in terms of product design. They don't let you follow someone. They don't allow you to ‘like’ something. They don't allow you to comment on something. They don't provide any index. They don't have searching, and if you don't have a Mirror token, you can't even have a website hosting all of your content. So this is a very strange thing for them to do from the perspective of web 2. But if we think about it in a more architectural way in terms of creative economy, storage, publishing, and distribution would be separated layers but working closely together with permissionless modules. Then they're doing something that's very Web3.

Distribution relationships and interactions should be offloaded to something RSS3 whereas they only work on publishing and they have storage on Arweave, and eventually Ithink RSS3 would be powering Mask so that on the rendering side, people would be seeing their Mirror articles natively on twitter. So I Think this is a very interesting example, whereas we have those social media that are completely based on web3 technology and we have applications or networks Mask that are based on existing social media and we have protocols and decentralized networks. Together, these four layers are gonna bring something that's brand new and that's powering something that was never possible before in web 2: You create something on one application and it will be stored on something on a network that could never expire and in your document or your articles will never be modified. Then, it will be distributed on another network which gives you permissionless access for distributing the content much more than before. Then you have a rendering network that does it natively on a platform that you're already familiar with. I think this is one of the examples that really completes this circle of web3 experience and in terms of native applications or sort of hybrid apps, I actually wrote an article about this before, but I think one of the major things that we are we providing real or or true value to users or even to the whole system. If we are, then it doesn't really matter if it's a hybrid system or it's a pure Web3 system. I think these systems will be working very closely together as they are built to be permissionless and to be something that was similar to what I was talking about before as the experiences that were never possible before

**Sam:**

It makes me wonder whether what we actually have here is protocol. Almost when you're building a piece of open source software. Of course you just include other people's bits of open source software and you end up building a dependency tree in a stack and you ship that and then people use the end product. It's got some shared underpinnings of other products but if you compare that to the web 2 space you get something Slack. In the background slack is using a lot of open source software, but to us it's just one monolithic thing. It's actually quite hard to stack Slack with anything else. That seems the way this is going. I think one of the things that's so amazing about Web3 or all of the networks that we're trying to build is that the sort of the dependency doesn't stop on the code layer. Or, it doesn't stop the code level but it does continue to the network level where the service actually happens. This is where all those amazing things would be built and with more open source permissionless networks coming around, I Think we're gonna see more amazing products or even networks building out as well.

\**Suji opens up the discussion to group questions. The first question comes from a Suji’s Friend Aphra called Loud Murmurs. **

**SUJI’S FRIEND: APHRA?**

My podcast is distributed through and RSS feed, obviously, but also there are multiple platforms in China which ask us to upload our own content into their platform, meaning that we have multiple hosting sites. As you all know, every single platform is trying to trap the users in their own ecosystem trying to hire their retention and it's pretty much against everything his whole panel is talking about. So, as a content creator, as someone who is dealing with communicating with different platforms, as someone who is always working on the boundary of censorship, I do believe having an open and decentralized platform for content creators is definitely really crucial.

**Sam:**

Absolutely. What got us started in this project in the first place was building a sensitive (censorship) resistant ledger for speech.There's actually someone in the audience, Xylophone here, who has built a decentralized sensitive(censorship?) resistant podcast hosting platform on ARWEAVE that uses RSS3.

**XYLOPHONE LUFFY:**

Yeah, I can give you a bit of background on Permacast. Permacast is an Arweave native podcast app that is fully decentralized so the front end and the back end are both built on Arweave. The back end actually runs off of a smart contract template which will spin up a new smart contracts for each new creator and so it means that every creator has their own interoperable bank of data that they can use that they can then export or that they can control on their own. It also exposes that data to any other application that wants to use it. Ithink the cool thing is that permacast right now is just a front end and it really is just in the back end a protocol and so it makes it possible for people to upload their podcasts and their episodes to to our front end but also it ensures that the no one is locked in to to that front end and that nobody is bound to use permacast in the future. They can build on top of it and iterate if necessary. As we were doing research into this project we were looking at how much it costs to host podcasts on a centralized platform and we were finding that it was something like 10 to 20 dollars a month. And if you were to do that through Permacast you'd need to be uploading something almost every day to reach the actual fee that it would cost to store it permanently and so audio mp3s are not actually that expensive through Arweave but they are made very expensive if you were to use a centralized provider which also locks you into their own RSS feed and all of their own functionality and so yeah, we've been trying to bridge that gap and trying to trying to bring podcasts through into Web 3 by working on integration with rss3 and also then working on integrations with your traditional web 2 providers. So we just shipped an upgrade where we can send podcasts via RSS to Spotify and Apple etc. I used to host a podcast myself and I found myself dissatisfied, I guess with the amount of money that was charged by hosts when all they were really doing was exposing your RSS feed to the public and being a generic file server so yeah that was the motivation behind that.

**Sam:**

Just think about that stack. If APHRA ? uploaded her podcast to permacast; it would also show up in RSS3. Then, Joshua you were saying that at some point in the future in Mask 2.0 if i'm not mistaken, then there's also going to be an integration between RSS3 and Mask.

**Cameron from Cent Enters the Call and gives a brief introduction on his project, Cent**

Cent is one part blogging platform and one part tweet marketplace and were definitely looking to expand more into the metaverse.

But Iwant to bring the conversation back to the collateralization of NFTs, because then you start to get into systems of credit. Historically, credit has been against all these other non-traditional assets your home and other things auto with very established market values. But as we get into more modes of value and more modes of valuation, people will have social reputations which to some extent will be liquid and they'll have margin collateralization ratios and they can borrow against it to pursue other initiatives. I think there are some early projects like Rocket nft Alex Masmej the founder of showtime was experimenting with that, but it's all so early in terms of the D5 Legos that are available. But that's something that Ithink is going to be really big as time goes on and as work gets more creative in terms of what I'm most interested in.

On the tokenization side , Iwant everything to be tokenized that is already by default ‘public’ because I Think that there's just so much data out there that right now lives in silos and doesn't give people any value other than li whatever serotonin boosts come from using the network that it's built on. By being able to liberate that data and put it back in the hands of people you're all of a sudden able to unlock all these different modes of value and as we saw with NFTs, your data isn't just valuable to advertisers, it could actually be valuable to your friends or your audience and people who are interested in your work. We only start to see these types of modes of interaction take place once we free the data but as long as the data is trapped you can't actually do anything with it. And so, what we're really interested in at Cent, is: how can we free other types of data that currently lives in social networks and is limited in terms of how it can escape.

SAM:

If I'm not mistaken, the toke model was quite different last year from the way it is now. It was this idea of purchasing recursive tips. Does that ring a bell?

CAMERON:

We launched an experimental subscription mechanism last year. It was called seating (???) It was one part patronage and one part investing. Effectively, if you gave early, recurring, and large amounts to a creator, then that would determine the “stake” that you had in future money that was pledged to that creator. So half of the money that got pledged to a creator at any given moment went to these past supporters. It was an experiment in trying to get people to want to support creators out of motivations other than just pure appreciation but also bringing in the speculative game. Ithink the problem that we saw there is that the market was very fragmented, and even today in the social currency space you see all these different competing models. You see bit clout, you see Creator Coins, and there's no clear model for what good distribution and good upside mechanics are. But what's really exciting is that everyone's trying. Everyone's trying out their own model and trying to figure out what works. We tried ours and frankly we struggled with it. That's the spirit of the ecosystem though: that you just experiment to see what sticks and for us we were trying that but it didn't work out. But then NFTs were also happening and so we started experimenting with them and obviously we see where we're at today with the ecosystem and the rate of acceleration.

S A M:

Do you have any learnings that you can share with us? Because I think that the token model probably makes slightly more sense than NFTs in their standard form. Also, social tokens in the form that we see them today are sort of “Ponzi Schemes for Good.”

CAMERON:

A couple things I'll point out. The first is that we very intentionally made it so that you didn't actually accrue tokens in the sense that you could go and trade them on an exchange. We didn't want the process of accruing tokens to interfere with the act of giving to a creator. So what we did in this model is you accrued points but the points were non-transferable. Ithink that dampened some of the excitement right because people love to be able to get out. They love the option to exit and so that was one thing. Ithink another thing that was interesting was we really tried to model it after services like patreon where there's this monthly recurring subscription aspect and the process of getting a monthly recurring on-chain transaction service off the ground on a network that not too many people know about was a really tall order. So I Think that even though we had a network going, it was really tough to get the critical mass to get this thing off the ground. You had to keep going in every month and clicking the seed button and once a month is a really long time to pass right to evaluate the result of an experiment. So it Ithink the velocity and the way that we had designed it made it hard for it to grow really quickly and so it ended up slowing usage toward the end of the year. So it was a really fun experiment, but I think the ponzionomics weren't juicy enough for the crowd.

S A M:

That's fascinating. Thank you for sharing, I feel we need a wiki that has a graveyard for mechanism designs, where there's post-mortems and what actually went wrong. There's so much interesting experimentation happening but I just wish you could go read about it.

CAMERON:

There's definitely a very overdue blog post on that at the very least that will definitely bv on web3 somewhere we'll find the right place to post it. I really do believe in the idea of non-transferable reputation and that if you start to accrue these points that confer status that they stay with you and that it's not something that you can just cash out because real world reputation doesn't work that way. It actually works much closer to collateralization and being able to borrow against your reputation and having a sense of creditworthiness based on the type of financial transactions you've had. I don't think that creator coins that are in their current form the liquid versions have much staying power. I think that they're very inferior models to their sort of non-transferable counterparts.

JOSHUA:

Yeah, I actually believe that that individual sort of tokens would have a very limited use case as well. I think lots of projects I’ve been trying very in various different ways to sort of make it work. It doesn't really give you a lot of utilities especially in terms of those who actually buy them. Other than building on the reputation, I think it's going to be a pretty long way for us to actually shape our ways utilizing social tokens to make a difference in terms of governance or money-making.

SAM:

So, what do we think about content tokens? From a regulatory point of view, they are not tied to the future management activities of a centralized party. In general, we can largely agree that that's the case. Although, I think if you're issuing an NFT drop where you're saying “oh our road map is this then that's pretty sketchy territory frankly. But putting that aside, social tokens from a regulatory point of view are legitimately just securities.

SUJI:

Yeah I'm okay if it's a security because by a very technical definition even your bank savings account is a security. Even the rent of your house is actually somehow secure as well but if you don't collateralize in huge amounts no one will care. If you say “Hey, I own a hundred buildings in San Francisco and I have a lot of revenue and just put it all together it's a security. So it's pretty much the same thing, I feel with social tokens.

GUEST Question:

These are my thoughts on social tokens and the economics around it: Here in india there is an app called Chingari, which released its own social tokens which is essentially betting in the present for future content creators. It's a clone of Tick-tock I would say, and I think a model like that would work fairly well here in India.

SAM:

The cool thing about Cent (or at least that particular model that you guys had a year ago) was this idea that you wanted to be early to back these things but by the nature of backing the content that you thought that other people would like later on. You're essentially taking part in this massive financial ranking mechanism. It's actually just the youtube suggestion algorithm except you're using financial incentives to get even higher quality results essentially.

GUEST:

Exactly. If you read about this company Royal by Justin Lau, you would see that there are incentives wherein the piece of music would be owned by the community. I think that’s just a play around the NFT. They could have also taken the other route as well on social tokens wherein you bet on the musician in the present day his potential and eventually that musician will be a rock star someday and you can of course monetize on it. So, only time will tell what essentially is the best model to go about it. I think right now social tokens seem to be a fair approach compared to NFTs and all the hype that is being created around it.

SAM:

Yeah, I think they are. I just wouldn't want to get involved with them because it feels pretty obvious to me that those are securities whereas there are models that aren't. If you get content specific tokens then then actually it's very fair to make an argument that says “No, I'm not investing in it or people aren't investing in this on the expectation of other people's future work” and subsequently it's not a security by definition. One model that we had in the Arweave ecosystem was people buying profit sharing tokens related to albums. So they built these band camp apps where basically as an artist you can release an album and you have a profit sharing token associated with it and then someone can come along and buy 20% of that from you. Then, when people go and tip later when they download the album, you get 20% of the tips and so of course you get the same the same ability well Ithink it's fair to say frankly you're obviously investing because you think that you found good quality content and other people are going to buy it in the future and you can get it for a good price today. It makes financial sense for the artist because they can take that 20% and they can Invest it in future albums which would have a different profit sharing token. So you don't have that linkage between expectation and future work of people. That's one of the ideas we've been looking at but I think it's shaky ground here. It's tricky and Ithink the NFT ecosystem a year ago you would never see a project in the NFT space that had a public roadmap of what they were going to do after they did the the NFT sale whereas now that's pretty common practice.

GUEST:

Exactly. Here in India what is happening is a lot of celebrities are coming up with their own tokens and the information is not so clear on what their future road maps and stuff are. I think this is the same time around 2017 when ICO’S were a hype. A lot of ponzi schemes came in and people simply just ran away from the projects. They just made money and then it was a ponzi dump scheme.

CAMERON:

I also want to add that even if the SEC and enforcement actions against non-compliant projects is definitely one threat. I think another threat that we’ve also got to be cognizant about is the circumstances that we're setting up creators for with a very irrational market. We have brought so many new people into the ecosystem and it's honestly amazing. This past year there's been so much growth outside of the pure finance aspects of crypto and into this sort of creative finance and there is gonna be a reckoning if we go into a bear market. We have to be mindful that the impact that we have isn't just on platform developers it's actually on individual artists and if a lot of these people who are buying these NFTs for ridiculous sums of money end up revealing that they are in it for purely speculative reasons then the person to blame isn't going to be a company anymore it's actually going to be individual artists and it's going to be very damaging. Probably much more damaging than a particular SEC enforcement action set a precedent because it's going to be much more widespread and so I think that there's a lot of things that we’ve got to be careful about and market mania is one, compliance is another, and i'm sure there's a handful of others.

S A M:

Yeah that's interesting Cam. Frankly, we shouldn't set up systems that are close to people investing in the future works of the creators. That is a bad idea both legally and and also ethically for the reasons you point out. I remember back in back in 2018, we had a bunch of people that owned those tokens and the bear market came and it was just a catastrophe. It was just awful for everyone and we were a company and we were only six or seven people at that point but we were a company. I can't imagine what that would be like for the creators involved. **I think we've all seen and heard backroom talk of projects whose community managers when token prices go down the community managers get death threats** and also and frankly I think in our team we even had instances of peoplee giving rape threats and this stuff. I've seen instances where community managers on our team frankly had mental breakdowns as a result of this stuff if you mix that with the naive, or crypto naive at least, or finance naive but very creative content makers on the internet. Listen, it's begging for disaster. We really have to find better models than that, whatever they are.

CAMERON:

I think the way to defuse that bomb is to really create a norm around minting. **Minting is not something that is an act of god, it is actually something that anyone can do and anyone can do like very frequently and I would actually argue that the more frequently we do it the more we're engaged in taking back=control of our data and just making it a part of our usage on the internet right memoizing all these things keeping a permanent record of it for our own use and maybe if we want to monetize it.** Sure we can but it's our data that's the future that I want to push us toward with NFTs. All of the hype built up around drops and making it such a monetized experience I don't think that will be what endures in the 2.0 version of NFTs whereas right now we're witnessing all the mania eventually that'll calm down and what remains? Well, digital rights management, ownership of your data and what you're able to do around transacting that. But it doesn't have to be these giant sales with huge expectations, it can just be a normal part of using the internet. And I think that in order to get to that level of normalcy just to tie it back up it's really about just hitting people with minting, making it a part of actions on different apps and services that they use and building systems where they control their data at the end of the day.

JOSHUA:

I actually wonder what is the biggest project or most successful project in terms of buying or meaning individual social tokens depending on the other person's future success is it big clout is is it is it rav?

CAM:

There's no clear winner I Would say.

SAM:

There's definitely no clear winner but but there's there are some models that are that are taking root more I think

CAMERON: Which ones are you got your eye on?

SAM:

I think the whole token space is a really interesting ideas there but I think it's security law disaster waiting to happen and I think it's only waiting to happen as long as one or maybe if there's a platform Bit cloud maybe until it gets the attention of the regulators and I think it will be a real problem so so Ii'm not so interested in those models I'm really interested in these models of monetizing content that concretely exists in a decentralized way so when it's on our weave right no one has to pay for storage ever again so you can say in a pretty reliable way no once no one is on the hook to perpetuate the or pay for the data storage costs for you in the future in order for that token that you're selling to have any value so so that's a plus yeah and when it's concrete that I think there's lots of interesting stuff we can do Ijust think that yeah it's it's playing with fire to go down this route

CAMERON: so the answer is none of those models

SAM:

The content monetization models Ithink are KOI in the in the audience here. I think they are a great example of this. They're doing something super interesting that basically allows you to monetize attention without having to show adverts. And once you have that sort of monetized attention stream you can trade interests in it. It's pretty clear that that's not a security. You're not basing your investment decisions in those assets on the expected future actions of someone. So you can be open about it as an investment. I think that's a model that will actually work in practice and continue to scale.

So, one of the things we saw in 2017/2018 was this ICO boom. ICO’s still exist but they exist as private token sales and they're operating in a totally different way. Generally speaking there are still public ICOs but they're pretty rare relative to what we currently have and so you could say that actually it wasn't every one of the ICOs of the future blah blah. But in the end, it was a regulatory problem that hit the brakes on the whole thing. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw the same thing if the NFT craze moved towards social tokens. that would be my expectation, actually. I think that we might even be heading that way because of this whole public road map blah blah blah or NFT project sort of direction things are taking Ithink that could that could come to a reckoning too because it just looks pretty obvious.

CAMERON: I think that also prompts the latest hotness around DAOs because those are also in the same space as social tokens. They're not led by a single person, which maybe gives them a little bit more credibility when it comes to the regulator's tests. But what are your thoughts around these community DAOs where allegedly no one is at the helm of the community? But they have a token issued and there's potentially sold and there's potentially expectations

SAM: \\

Well, there are multiple angles of danger here. You have the the regulatory concerns around the sale of the tokens or the release of the tokens even in the first place- because of course the SEC defines that the “investments of money” can also be work or some action. So that's pretty tricky.

Another component is the closest legal structure that this stuff fits into generally tends to be a general partnership which is a disaster if you're just a typical DAO member. You don't want to be in a general partnership. Everybody's liable. You've got one token in this DAO, you have zero control over what it's up to, and you're completely personally legally liable for its activities that's absolutely catastrophically bad.

Another question that needs to be answered is: “Well hold on, didn't we get into this in the first place to build applications that were trustless? So if we just recreate more or less a corporation structure with maybe slightly different voting rules or something, or maybe there's no board there's this direct democracy well I hink we're exposing the applications to exactly the same pitfalls that we got in the Web 2 space.

I don't trust Uniswap. At this point I wouldn't Iwould Iwould rather trust what 201 maker dow than today because I have to trust that the dow backing the application doesn't screw up I don't want that. What I want is Bitcoin or Ether arguably and Arweave these are protocols which nobody can control and change. You don't have to trust anyone to know what they're going to do in two or three years. The rules are set in stone already. I think that's the really exciting thing about this space.

CAMERON:

I think the maker dow example is definitely the most prescient. They're effectively functioning as a bank, whereas initially they released what's now referred to as SCAI the single collateral die. That was only using Eth under the hood and Iwas really on board with that visio. Then, when it came to governing which assets they store as collateral (and now I think it's some double-digit percentage of USDC) even right back to not being USDC dominant, today I think or yesterday it's now dominant again.

One angle is: yes these people are acting as the new masters and that's definitely deeply disappointing to me. Then the other aspect is : I also feel there's a sort of stagnation that happens when these projects are first being incubated. It's difficult to establish a clear charter without strong leadership and so I just question how far some of the early stage DAOs are gonna end up getting. I think that they're inevitably gonna run into directional challenges where maybe they want to do this or that and they can't focus their resources because they have a commitment to decentralization. But without a clean charter from the outset, they'll never really be able to get off the ground. So those are my two perspectives on it.

SAM:

Even bitcoin at the beginning needed Satoshi to set the rules of the game and set the purpose of the thing. And then, after that, they stepped back. But at the beginning it was founder-led in the same way a start up is.

GUEST

Ithink I have a saying that a lot of DAOs will be ghost towns eventually.

JOSH:  
I agree. I think we're actually seeing the start of that. DAOs are actually legally recognized in Wyoming now. I think these DAOs would be private, similar to a partnership. Otherwise, I just have no idea how they're going to legitimize that thing because if it's a public DAO the whole thing would be pretty hard for regulations to work.But if it's private, then it sounds more like a company, you just have a lot of shareholders, you have a company that does certain things, you have certain ways of of running your own sort of organization, you probably you don't have a board but you have a democracy in your own group. But it does matter to what extent this thing is private.

For example, if you look at Friends With Benefits, they are not completely public, whereas they could just buy the token and become a member of that thing. I think you have to fill in some sort of application and they give the right to buy their token. I think in ways it's' still too the question would be if we're gonna see more private DAOs or closed DAOs, to what extent is that thing is gonna be is it gonna be completely closed? All the partners or the Dao members will be set by the beginning of the Dao or would it be something halfway open.

SAM:

The optimistic case is pretty obvious that well at least now we can program the organizations quickly. So that's the good thing about DAO’s. One of the things i'm really interested in is how we can incentivize good governance If it's private other than just being fast to get started with. What is the benefit over a corporation which has exactly the same tax structure? So on yeah it's an interesting question.

CAMERON

I also think that something that is private is not necessarily a DAO. I feel that's the a endow is autonomous and if it's closed off Ii have a really tough time believing that it has the capacity to truly be autonomous and sort of self-sufficient because by virtue of his closeness there's no permissionless sort of opt-in way to it's for it to grow and so I Think maybe it's just a doe a D.O

SAM

I think if you want to be really edgy about it you could argue that actually a company is a Dao by the literal sense of the words. I mean it's decentralized, okay so it's got multiple members. Well that defines almost every company in the world. It's autonomous. Well from a legal perspective it exists outside of each of its individual members so Iguess it's autonomous. And it's obviously an organization, so if you wanted to be obtuse about it you could definitely argue that it's not clear to me what on-chain organizations might have even been a better phrase for it but Iguess they're too late on that front.

CAMERON: I think of bitcoin as the prototypic dow because mining bootstraps to me mining was the autonomous component right it's a permissionless way for it to just continue to exist and when we talk about how we test from the efforts of others Ithink what we can see is that that effort is pretty clearly distributed among the people who are participating in it at least early on and and so I Don't know yeah i'm just being pedantic but Ii to see systems where you can come in and and and start adding value Iactually didn't know that FWB didn't let you Happen to own fwb i'm no longer in it because Ithink they raised their threshold I Bought I Got it when Iwas I Don't remember but they progressively kept raising the amount that you needed to be a member and I Just didn't do that but at the time it was open for me to just buy it on uniswap so i'm surprised that they would close that off that seems counter the values of the space that we're in.
