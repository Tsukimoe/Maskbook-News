In the past year, Mask Network has initiated a few programs including but not limited to the ETHShanghai Hackathon, scholarships, Gitcoin Grants Round 15 social ecosystem round, and onwards.

Slowly but surely, we have outgrown our original products, including the Mask browser extension and Next.ID, and are forming a vaster ecosystem. As such, it’s time to officially announce Mask Network’s ecosystem programs for the public to participate in and get involved in a more structured and transparent way.

We welcome open applications from projects of all areas to our ecosystem programs (4+). Besides the past programs, this is also the debut we made for the Mask grant program.

## The Mask Network Ecosystem

Mask Network has been consistently building the Web3 Social ecosystem.

Internally, we’ve been building Mask Network and Next.ID. Externally, we support Web3 projects via grants, investments, and hackathons. By doing these, we have grown an ecosystem of over 100 projects with wide coverage over social protocols, social apps, infrastructures, games, and social intelligence.

Of course, we couldn’t have achieved all these without our partners’ support. To name a few:

* Our underlying layers include data providers such as DeBank, CoinGecko, NFTScan, Inspect, Biteye and Adot
* Our storage providers include Kwil, Arweave, Ceramic and IPFS
* Other partners include our bandwidth provider Meson and security provider Runtime Verification

With the support of these partners, Mask Network builds on them to deliver a set of Web3 native social products and DID protocols that offer users secure, rich, and decentralized experiences and make up for a thriving Web3 social ecosystem.
