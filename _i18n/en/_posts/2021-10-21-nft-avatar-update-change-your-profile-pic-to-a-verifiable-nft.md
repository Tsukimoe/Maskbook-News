A few weeks ago, we introduced the **NFT Avatar**, a feature that authenticates users who use NFTs they own as profile pics and allows them to directly see information such as the collections & prices of that NFT.

NFT Avatar just went through a major update. Now, by connecting to your wallet, **everyone can finally change their Twitter profile pic into an NFT (on Ethereum) they own directly on Twitter**. This will be available in the upcoming v1.38.0.

After update v1.38.0, a ‚Äúüî• Twitter Avatar‚Äù tab will appear on the Twitter profile page:

Click the tab and all available NFTs will be visible to check in the pop-up window. You can then set an NFT as your profile pic, and the whole process will take place on Twitter without you having to leave the site.

After setting the NFT as a profile pic, the NFTs will be authenticated and all Mask users will be able to check the authentication banner.

Currently, you can only set the NFT Avatar through the browser extension. The authentication banner, however, can be seen on both browser & mobile devices. In the future, NFT-related features will be much more powerful for mobile devices. With a few taps, you will be able to purchase and display NFTs.

More NFT-related features will be available soon that appeal to various NFT users. Please stay tuned!
