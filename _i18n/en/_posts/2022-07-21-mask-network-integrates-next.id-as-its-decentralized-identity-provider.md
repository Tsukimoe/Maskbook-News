Mask Network is proud to announce that we’re partnering with [Next.ID](https://next.id/) as its Decentralized-Identity-as-a-Service (DIaaS) of choice. Mask Network’s major overarching goal is to be a bridge for all internet users to eventually gain exposure and understanding of Web3, and this is a huge step in that direction.

### What is Next.ID?

Next.ID is a decentralized identity aggregator that’s building the base layer of identities. It takes a unique approach to decentralized identities by seamlessly integrating both Web2 and Web3 accounts, creating a highly interoperable layer where both coexist.

This allows, for example, Twitter users to create social networks with MetaMask holders, building completely new social networks from the ground up in a permissionless manner.

It’s empowered to do this via 3 technical innovations:

* ProofService, a blockchain-like model that ensures data integrity
* KVService, data organization and storage to keep information flow seamless
* RelationService, an aggregator that integrates existing IDs, ID queries, and IDs bound to and in parallel to Next.ID

### Why Next.ID?

Mask Network is committed to working with decentralized protocols with the same vision: an interconnected space not dominated by any single entities. Next.ID’s founding principles as a DIaaS facilitates such a future, working with – instead of competing with – other DID providers to build an interoperable future.
