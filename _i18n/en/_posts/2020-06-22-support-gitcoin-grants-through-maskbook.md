In early 2020, Mask Network launched a special feature called "Red Packet", which allowed users to claim and distribute cryptocurrencies on Twitter. This is the first time you can send decentralized cryptocurrencies on centralized social media platforms.

Now we are proud to announce that Mask Network and Gitcoin have worked together to develop a new plugin within Mask Network. Now you can fund Gitcoin Grants directly on Twitter.

The Gitcoin Grants Round 6 will start soon on June 15th, and Mask Network will fully support this Grant.

What Mask Network wants to do is to make people aware of the value of Gitcoin Grants. Also, we want to build a bridge connecting Web2.0 and Web3.0 and incentivize more people to join the blockchain community.

With Maskbook, it has never been easier for creators of Gitcoin Grants to share links on Twitter. In addition, Maskbook users would be able to identify the Grants immediately and fund the Grants directly on Twitter. You can also retweet and let more people know about this grant.

Gitcoin Grants is an experiment where people can fund their open source projects for public benefit with QF (Quadratic Funding) matching contributions from Gitcoinâ€™s QF Fund sponsored by donors in the Ethereum ecosystem. As an example, a project that receives 50 individual 1 DAI donations will receive a significantly higher amount in grant funding from the matching pool than another project that receives a single 100 DAI donation.

Gitcoin, with the support of the Ethereum Foundation and other matching partners â€” to run at least quarterly rounds in 2020, with a planned 4 QF rounds.
