Just in 2020, over a hundred plant and animal species have been deemed extinct to various degrees and scales. The current global species extinction rate is out of reach, and it is also accelerating, according to scientists from the intergovernmental biodiversity forum. Nearly a quarter of all plants on the globe are in danger of extinction in the coming decades. Meanwhile, in areas where natural environments and wildlife are protected, disadvantaged populations bear the entire burden of maintenance, despite the fact that the gains are shared by all humans. While we today have more opportunities than ever before, they are dependent on a growing willingness to sacrifice nature's potential to contribute in the future. Are we really using the logic of "pollute first, clean up later; harm first, patch later" in this emerging modern world? We need to integrate the true importance of nature into our sustainable growth paradigm, fund environmental conservation in novel ways, and improve scientific wildlife protection and knowledge building for related experts.

The China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF) Youth Leader Fund will collaborate with Mask Network to create a more sustainable and responsible development paradigm in a new order, beginning with biodiversity conservation. On Earth Day, we'll choose three endangered species: the Black-faced spoonbill, Przewalski's gazelle, and the Ili pika, and invite artists and designers to make NFTs and copper prints based on real-life photographs from the CBCGDF Community-based Conservation Areas. The winner of the auction will receive a physical replica of the copper print, which will be autographed by the artist. We hope to relay the idea that every endangered species is the "protagonist" of the earth's life network, and that continuous care and conservation of natural organisms can become a norm, by using pop art's imaginative vocabulary, combining the meaning and cultural symbols of the commercial period. At the same time, we hope that by holding this auction, we will be able to spread their image and circumstance to those who are discovering the modern world, guiding people to consider the relationship between biodiversity and human existence and development, allowing the digital world to transcend the old development paradigm. This is also an opportunity for the crypto community and the general public to "breakthrough" on the subject.

We'll keep collecting and documenting data on endangered plants and animals, combining it with various art forms. We want to create an online museum in the future to permanently archive the creatures that offer mobility and nourishment to our basic but critical living conditions. Furthermore, the output of NFTs would be carbon neutral. A part of the proceeds from the auction will go toward supporting the artist/designer collective who makes for us, and another portion will go toward wildlife conservation studies and front-line worker supports.

In this process of alternating the old and the new, we hope to use the land beneath our feet, the sky above our heads, the plants that grow, the animals that run... these creatures that provide the most basic and indispensable materials for our survival and development, and use Mask Network as a bridge between the scenes of the old and the new worlds, so that our thinking could land in the new world while brings back to the old world order, to rethink the relationship between humans and nature.

On April 22nd, join us in making our interactions responsible and meaningful.
