Mask Network is happy to announce that the $MASK — $USDC pair is on QuickSwap Liquidity Mining Pool, and our native token $MASK is listed on Dragon’s Syrup.

After the integration of Polygon (Matic) in June, our team has been working hard in bringing good projects on Polygon to Mask extension. Users can now use QuickSwap on the Mask extension, providing more choices to users when swapping assets on Polygon (Matic).

**About Quickswap**

QuickSwap is a fork of the originator of Automated Market Makers in the now rapidly expanding DeFi sector of the Cryptocurrency industry, Uniswap. Both, of course, are magical. Only, rather than settling for the magic of unicorns, we’ve opted for the magic of dragons. It’s a much faster kind of magic, currently only available in a land far far away, known by the locals as Layer 2. Although it’s very very far far away, to get there requires only a few clicks on a mouse, via the magical MATIC portal, aided by a fanciful Fox with a Mask.
