Following the widely recognized features such as ITO (Initial Twitter Offering) and token price info display & swap, Mask Network is once again welcoming new features in the NFT realm. After supporting the display and bidding of NFTs on platforms such as OpenSea and Rarible, the NFT Gallery feature is about to go live on the Mask extension, which provides **a place to display NFT collection right on top of the curator’s social media profile, provides an alternative to NFTs after they have been “bid, sold, and owned”.**

Mask Network has always been cultivating in the NFT realm. During the 2020 U.S. election, Mask introduced the concept of NFT to mainstream social media by distributing the “Election Special NFTs.” In early 2021, when the NFT concept started to gain momentum, Mask Network supported the identification and display of URLs of works in well-known NFT platforms such as OpenSea and Rarible. Through the Mask extension, users can view the prices of NFTs directly on Twitter and bid on them immediately. But this only covers the tip of the iceberg of the NFT world. More applications for NFT beyond being minted, traded, and auctioned are yet to be explored.

Mask has introduced the NFT Gallery feature in the **yet-to-be-released v1.36.6 (click** [**here**](https://github.com/DimensionDev/Maskbook/releases/download/v1.36.6/Maskbook.chromium.zip) **to download and try it first!)**. After installing the Mask extension and switch to the Ethereum mainnet, users can view the NFTs owned by others on their personal homepage, below the “NFTs” tab. Users could also include their ENS information in their Twitter username or bio, to display the NFTs they own.

We believe that the NFT Gallery is not only a list of NFTs, a platform to display the NFTs owned by users, but also **a window to the metaverse**. Just as the NFT itself is more than art, the NFT Gallery is more than the user’s aesthetic taste. It implies user’s personal characteristics and their life in the Web 3.0 world. Through this window, you can see others’ CryptoPunks, Loots, NFT cards, ENS domains, and other virtual identities in the Web 3.0 metaverse.

NFT is crucial in the building of the metaverse, which is why Mask Network chose to develop the NFT Gallery feature when building the bridge between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. Mask hopes that more users will get a glimpse of the vast Web 3.0 world and become interested in it on Twitter.
