Mask Network and RSS3, the feed of Web3, have reached a strategic partnership in the integration of users’ footprint, Gitcoin donations, and NFT function. In the future, the RSS3 protocol will be integrated into the “Web3” tab on Mask Network, so users can combine their Web 3.0 address and display the activities they did with the address on their Web 2.0 social media profile.

RSS3 aims to become the backbone of future social, content, and e-commerce applications by providing content, distribution channel, and economic environment. This integration is an improvement of the Web3 native function in Mask 2.0. After the Mask Network connects to RSS3, it can index rich assets and content information for user experience.

Trying to be the bridge between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0, Mask Network is connecting and integrating various decentralized applications and bringing them on top of mainstream social networks. Mask is trying to enrich social network newsfeed by displaying users’ Web 3.0 activities. By signing and confirming the wallet address, the user can connect their RSS3 profile associated with that wallet address and display them in the Web3 tab, on their Twitter personal profile.
