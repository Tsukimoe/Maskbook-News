Mask Network is now live on Polygon and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), officially declare the beginning of the Web 3.0 multi-chain era.

Mask Network is dedicated to searching for excellent Web 3.0 applications and to providing a better product experience at a lower cost. The skyrocketing Ethereum price (and its fluctuation), as well as the rising numbers of blockchain users and DApps, results in a very congested and pricey Ethereum network. More and more projects started to look for solutions on Layer2 and other chains. Mask Network has been continuously selecting and adjusting solutions and has reached an agreement with Polygon and BSC to create and complete the multi-chain metaverse of Mask Network together.

* _Polygon provides a cost-effective, speedy cross-chain solution. Polygon is a Layer2 solution blockchain, which provides scalable, secure, and instant Ethereum transactions using Plasma side-chains and a Proof-of-Stake network._
* _BSC boasts smart contract functionality and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The design goal here was to leave the high throughput of the Binance chain intact while introducing smart contracts into its ecosystem._

After the official integration of Polygon and BSC, DApps in the Mask Network ecosystem will no longer be limited to Ethereum. This allows the creation of faster and cheaper DApps, and will expand the landscape of the Mask Network ecosystem significantly; amazing DApps on Polygon and BSC network will also be able to reach more users through Mask Network. The existing Red Packet plugin is available on multi-chain, users could use the Polygon network or BSC network to receive or send Twitter Red Packet. Other features such as ITO and Swaps will also be live on multi-chain, thereby reducing costs and attract more users.

For Mask Network, the integration with Polygon and BSC also means a more diverse user base from various ecosystems. We look forward to seeing more creative ways of using the Mask Network extension; when the gas fee increases, users will also have a wider selection, to avoid unnecessary loss.

We are excited about the multi-chain era. This not only lowers the cost for users, provides a richer experience but is also an inevitable stage of Mask Networkâ€™s vision of creating an open internet of the future. We hope to make Web 3.0 a digital world that is easier and more user-friendly.
