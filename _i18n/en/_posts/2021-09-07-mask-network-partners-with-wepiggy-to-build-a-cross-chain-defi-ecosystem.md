We are excited to announce that Mask Network builds a partnership with lending protocol WePiggy. The two parties will jointly explore the possibilities of technology integrations, and work together to build a cross-chain DeFi ecosystem.

Mask Network has been trying to create a decentralized applet (DApplet) ecosystem, and we position ourselves to be the bridge that connects internet users from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. WePiggy focuses on building an open-source, non-custodial crypto-asset lending market protocol that helps users realize asset appreciation and maximize utilization across many blockchain networks. Both parties will work together in fields such as cross-chain DeFi ecosystem building, trying to build a broader on-chain world.

Mask Network and WePiggy have reached an agreement on the cross-chain DeFi ecosystem building. The cooperation will move forward steadily in stages according to the will of both parties.

Starting with cross-chain lending market building: **$MASK token has been evaluated and proposed to be listed on WePiggy lending protocol through WIP23 official governance voting**.

**$MASK will be listed on the BSC mainnet at 15:00 UTC+8 Time on Sep 8.**

**$MASK will be listed on the ETH mainnet after Chainlink’s price feeds are ready to ensure the security of the lending and liquidation process.**

Mask Network will contribute to the trading liquidity building on DEXs, and the liquidity of MASK token in WePiggy’s lending market, to eliminate systemic risk of WePiggy protocol as much as possible.

More cooperation between WePiggy and MASK Network is on the way, $MASK token holders will be able to use features such as diversified portfolio management, cross-chain asset transfer, and lending on WePiggy in the future.
