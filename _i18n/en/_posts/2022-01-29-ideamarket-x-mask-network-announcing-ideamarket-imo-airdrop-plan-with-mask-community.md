Mask Network is thrilled to announce a partnership with Ideamarket, the literal marketplace for ideas, and Mask Network is proud to participate in Ideamarket’s airdrop plan, as they launch their token $IMO on 2nd February 2022.

Ideamarket was launched in February 2021 and is a dApp live on Arbitrum that aims to create public narratives without trusted middlemen while incentivizing veracity in the information that bombards us 24/7. Ideamarket recognized that the process for creating public knowledge hasn’t changed in centuries — authority manufactures certainty and enforces it. From Ancient kings and emperors, the church in Galileo’s time, to the media and scientific establishment today. Therefore, they tried to create a system, or a market that could be used to decide what deserves public credibility, and make credibility increasingly expensive to fake. In short, Ideamarket wants to “make lying expensive.”

Ideamarket’s vision aligns well with that of Mask Network’s aim to make data autonomy accessible to all. Ideamarket will be integrated on the Mask Network as a dapplet, allowing users to view credibility ratings of accounts and measure earnings in proportion to their trust score on mainstream social networks.

Ideamarket is also initiating a generous airdrop to Mask Network users and has reserved 250,000 $IMO tokens for 250 Mask Network active members of the community, Each user will get 1,000 $IMO. Please check the details below:
