To ensure the security of user assets, Mask Network invited SlowMist to conduct an audit of Mask Network’s ITO contract from June 7 to June 15, 2021. We are delighted to announce that the Mask Network Initial Twitter Offering contract has successfully passed the SlowMist security audit, that **the contract was free of security vulnerabilities and weaknesses**.

SlowMist adopted a white box test, conducting vulnerability analysis and vulnerability mining based on the source code of the ITO contract and security tests on the code modules through scripting tools, and conducting security tests from an external attacker’s perspective, combined manual and internal tools. Following this audit, Mask Network will continue to monitor potential issues that may arise to ensure the smooth implementation of ITO and other related processes and functions to keep user assets and information secure.

Technology is the foundation of the smooth and secure operation of the Mask extension. We rely on code and contracts to bring our ideas of Web 3.0 and decentralization to life. Therefore, we attach a high priority to the technical security of the Mask extension. The industry has been paying extra attention to contract security. With this audit, Mask Network hopes to demonstrate a responsible and rigorous attitude to our users and will continue to be vigilant about technical issues in the future to deliver a better user security experience.

After the integration of Polygon and BSC, all functions on the Mask extension (ITO, Swap…) have been available on multi-chained. Mask Network will conduct long-term cooperation with SlowMist Technology to ensure the high technical requirements and further protect users’ operation in the era of multi-chain.
